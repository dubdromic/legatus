# Legatus

This is a little top-down space shooter to experiment with
[Gosu](https://github.com/gosu/gosu).

There's no real organization or plan here; this is meant as a proving ground
for various design patterns or anything else I want to try in the context of a
game loop.

To "play":

```Ruby
bundle install
bundle exec ruby legatus.rb
```

Enjoy. :thumbsup:
